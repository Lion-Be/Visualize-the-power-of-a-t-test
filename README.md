# Visualize-the-power-of-a-t-test

BACKGROUND
This function constitutes a programming exercise as part of my Methodology & Statistics M.Sc. program at Utrecht University.

CONTENT
The user can both graphically and visually inspect the power of an independent samples t-test based on simulations. 

The following population parameters need to be specified: 
n.s1 = Number of observation group 1
mean.s1 = Mean group 1
sd.s1 = Standard deviation group 1

n.s2 = Number of observation group 2
mean.s2 = Mean group 2
sd.s2 = Standard deviation group 2

The following simulation parameters need to be specified:
alpha = Desired alpha threshold to determine significance
test.number = Desired number of simulations
