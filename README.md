# Visualizing the Power of a T-Test (A/B Testing)

## :star: Purpose
This code consists of a programming exercise that I worked on in the first semester of my M.Sc. studies in [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en). The user can both graphically and visually inspect the power of an independent samples t-test based on simulations. 

The following **population parameters** need to be specified: 
- n.s1 = Number of observations group 1
- mean.s1 = Mean group 1
- sd.s1 = Standard deviation group 1

- n.s2 = Number of observation group 2
- mean.s2 = Mean group 2
- sd.s2 = Standard deviation group 2

The following **simulation parameters** need to be specified:
- alpha = Desired alpha threshold to determine significance
- test.number = Desired number of simulations
